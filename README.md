## 🧠📦 DSA_using_C

**DSA_using_C** is a systems-focused Data Structures & Algorithms repository written entirely in **pure C**.
All structures are implemented from scratch with explicit pointer manipulation, manual memory management, and invariant correctness.

The goal is not API usage, but **learning how data structures actually work in memory**, preparing for open-source C contributions, GSoC, and systems-oriented FAANG roles.

## ⚙️ Build & Run

From the `linkedlist_stack_queue` directory:

```bash

gcc ^
main.c ^
sll.c ^
dll.c ^
circular_queue.c ^
..\trees\binary_search_tree.c ^
..\expression_evaluation\infix_to_postfix.c ^
..\expression_evaluation\postfix_evaluation.c ^
..\expression_evaluation\stack.c ^
-I. ^
-I..\trees ^
-I..\expression_evaluation ^
-o main.exe

```

This project is intentionally compiled using **explicit multi-file compilation and linking** to reinforce understanding of translation units, include paths, and linker behavior.

🖥️🎮 Console-Based Application

This repository now includes a fully functional, menu-driven console application that lets you interactively explore and validate all implemented data structures and algorithms from a single place 🚀

How to use it:

1️⃣ Clone the repository
2️⃣ Move into the linkedlist_stack_queue directory 📂
3️⃣ Compile the project using the build command shown above 🛠️
4️⃣ Run main.exe and start interacting via the console 🧑‍💻✨

From the menu, you can work with:

🔹 Singly Linked List
🔹 Doubly Linked List
🔹 Circular Queue
🔹 Binary Search Tree
🔹 Infix → Postfix conversion
🔹 Postfix evaluation

This console driver acts as a control layer 🎛️ and verification playground 🧩, making it easy to observe behavior, edge cases, and internal invariants across modules — step by step, in real time ⚙️🧠

## 🧩 Core Focus Areas

* Modular C design using `.h` / `.c` separation
* Pointer semantics and pointer-to-pointer usage
* Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc` / `free`)
* Ownership, lifetime, and NULL-safety reasoning
* Debugging compilation and linker errors

---

## 🧱 Implemented Data Structures

**Singly Linked List**
Full CRUD operations, pointer-based reversal, correct head manipulation, and edge-case handling.

**Doubly Linked List**
Bidirectional traversal with strict `prev` / `next` invariant maintenance and safe deletions.

**Stack (Linked List Based)**
Abstracted over a singly linked list with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, and `destroyStack`.

**Circular Queue (Array Based)**
Fixed-size implementation using modulo arithmetic, maintaining a one-empty-slot invariant to distinguish full vs empty states.

**Binary Search Tree (BST)**
Recursive insertion, in-order / pre-order / post-order traversals, and node counting.

---

## 🔢 Expression Parsing

* **Infix → Postfix conversion** using a stack
* **Postfix evaluation** with safe operand handling

Focus is on operator precedence, associativity, and stack discipline.

---

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

All structures are tested via **console-based dispatcher programs**, with emphasis on:

* Empty and single-element cases
* Overflow / underflow behavior
* Pointer safety and memory cleanup

Reasoning precedes execution.
